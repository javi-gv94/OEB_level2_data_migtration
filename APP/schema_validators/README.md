# Extended JSON Schema validators
**Original code obtained from https://github.com/inab/extended-json-schema-validators**

The common reference JSON Schema validation and consistency check tools are hosted in this project. The code was originally hosted in the OpenEBench Benchmarking Data Model repository.

These tools were designed to work on complete sets of JSON files, spread over several directories. The core of these tools has been reused in several projects. The first extensions they implement were initially created in the FAIRification of Genomic Data Tracks Implementation Study.

You can use any of the reference implementations (currently [Perl 5](perl5), [Python 2.x / 3.x](python) and [Java 8](java)), as any of them should do the same validations and consistency checks than the others.
